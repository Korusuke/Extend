# Extend
---
Extend is a mobile application, more like a proof of concept to extend our tiny mobile displays, by virtually connecting multiple devices together, in turn forming _"one huge virtual display"_.


# Features
- Sets up an HTTP server on each Peer device.
- Uses [ping_discover_network]() to find peers connected to the same Wifi network.
- Adopts Master / Slave Architecture to setup connection between peers.
- Can be extended to any application use case.

# Steps to run
- Download the APK on devices connected to the same network.
- Click connect on any of the device, the first to initiate becomes master.
- It automatically scans for other peer devices and sets up connection between them.
- Enjoy the image slideshow demo!
